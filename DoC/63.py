# This problem was asked by Microsoft.

# Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.

# For example, given the following matrix:

# [['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
#  ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
#  ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
#  ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]
# and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', you should return true, since it's the last row.


# Method #1
# The first method is straighforward, first check corner cases: if the given word is more than 4 characters long
# then check if the first letter of the given word appears in the first line or first column
# then repeat the process for all four characters

def is_found(matrix, word):
  if len(word)
  return answer


word_matrix = 

# Method #2
# convert letters in word into characters and convert characters into numbers
# calculate the given word's sum of number representation of
